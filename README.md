What is KitKatStepCounter
-------------------------
KitKatStepCounter is just a quick, simple app I build to test the new 'Step Detector' sensor that was made available in Android 4.4 KitKat. The app simply measures the number of steps you take and displays the number on the screen. The app also runs in the background so you is not required to have it open all the time. If you just want to try the app, it is available on the Play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.a64adam.kks).
